NOTES: 

* the time stamp can be the date the action was entered or the last time the action was taken.
- TODO: this is something that needs to be done, no further specification if this can be done now or not.
- NEXT: this is something that can be done /now/, you have everything you need to start doing it.  This is what /next actions/ are about.
- WAITING: This item cannot be done now, because we are waiting for something.  Somebody else needs to act, some material needs to arrive, etc.
- SOMEDAY: means that you have not decided that this needs to be done.
- Urgent: (a binary column — urgent or not urgent)
- Where: (home, at work, computer, in car, etc.)
- Project: Which project is this task part of 
- Due: If there is a particular due date
- Tickle: If nothing can be done until a particular date, put the date here
- Status: open, closed
- Action: What to do next on this task

* Keep all tasks, tickles, and projects in one sheet. 
- To see tickles for today,  sort by the “tickle” column. 
- To see what is due next, sort by the “Due” column. 
- To see what is urgent, sort by the “urgent” column
- to see what is up with a particular project, sort by the project column, 
-- which groups all the actions associated with a single project together.
- This has been working very well for me, combined with a daily 
-- “don’t go to bed until you’ve done these things” checklist, which is things like:
- Empty email inbox
- Empty desk inbox
- Empty voice recorder

# GTD
Getting Things Done (GTD) in an ultra simple CSV file directly in github, no programming or coding necessary.  
The 'GTD' data is inserted in the GTD.csv file which can later be searched directly in github with the search function available in github for .csv files (the first line above the table is a .csv search function).  
A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values.  
It stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text.  
Each line of the file is a data record.  
Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas.
